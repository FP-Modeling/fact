First, I must acknowledge my main advisor, Edil Medeiros.
Since graduation, and now in my masters, he trusted that my effort could go on and beyond, surpassing my own expectations
and limits, getting out of my comfort zone. All the endless meetings, including on the weekends, filled with thoughtful advice and helpful comments,
will be the most remarkable memory of the best mentor I have encountered to this day -- a title that Edil got back when I was doing graduation, and he
continues to be worthy.

I'm thankful to my Computer Science study group, Dr.Nekoma, for the continued joyful programming practices leveraging functional programming principles, something that is
still the core foundation of the present work, even though this paradigm remains uncommon both in the industry of software development industry and in academia.

I'm grateful for the company I'm currently working in, Tontine Trust, where I'm a member of a great team delivering a challenging product to the market. Some of these challenges are being solved in Haskell; a programming language
I grew fond of it since my final graduation project was written in it. This work is a continuation of that.

Finally, a special thanks to everybody who took any amount of time to read any draft I had of this dissertation, providing honest feedback.
