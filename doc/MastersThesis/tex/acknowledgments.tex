First and foremost, I thank my main advisor Edil Medeiros.
Since graduation, and now in my masters, he trusted that my effort could go on and beyond, surpassing my own expectations
and limits, getting out of my comfort zone. All the endless meetings, including on the weekends, filled with thoughtful advice and helpful comments,
will be the most remarkable memory of the best teacher I have encountered to this day -- title that Edil got back when I was doing graduation and he
continues to be worthy.

I'm thankful to my Computer Science study group, Dr.Nekoma, for the continue joyful programminig practices leveraging functional programming principles, something that is
still the core foundation of the present work, even though this paradigm remains as uncommon both in the industry of software development and in the academia.

I'm grateful for the company I'm currently working in, Tontine Trust, where I'm surrounded by real problems being solved in the Haskell; a programming language
that I ended up being a fond of since my final graduation project written in it.

Finally, a special thanks for everybody that took any amount of time to read any draft I had of this thesis, providing honest feedback to enhance my thesis
before the end of my masters.
