Physical phenomena are difficult to properly model due to their continuous nature. Its paralellism and nuances were a challenge before the transistor, and even after the digital computer it still is an unsolved issue. In the past, some formalism were brought with the General Purpose Analog Computer proposed by Shannon in the 1940s. Unfortunately, this formal foundation was lost in time, with \textit{ad-hoc} practices becoming mainstream to simulate continuous time. In this work, we propose a domain-specific language (DSL) -- FACT and its evolution FFACT -- written in Haskell that resembles GPAC's concepts. The main goal is to take advantage of high level abtractions, both from the areas of programming and mathematics, to execute systems of differential equations, which describe physical problems mathematically. We evaluate performance and domain problems and address them accordingly. Future improvements for the DSL are also explored and detailed.
