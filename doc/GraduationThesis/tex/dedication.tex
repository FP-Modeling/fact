I dedicate this milestone to my family. To my sister Alexya Lemos, for the memorable moments of joy and fun. To my father Rodolfo Rocha, for sharing with me his wise and insightful perceptions about life. And foremost, to my mom Dania Lemos, for her relentless will of teaching me the basics of everything since infancy, for her always-present joyful smiles to alleviate my painful academic journey, for being my golden guardian during my countless unhealthy decisions in pursuit of doing the best regardless of the cost, for being an example of an unstoppable warrior for me to follow.
