First and foremost, I thank my advisor José Edil Guimarães for beliving in my potential of accomplishing a memorable landmark. He trusted that my effort could go on and beyond, surpassing my own expectations and limits, even without having any experience with the chosen domain of the project. All the endless meetings, including on the weekends, filled with thoughtful advice and helpful comments, will be the most remarkable memory of the best teacher I have encountered to this day.

I'm thankful for my colleague Breno Fatureto for inviting me to this beautiful and elegant world of functional programming, which is the core foundation of the present work, even though this being an uncommon paradigm to explore during graduation.

I'm grateful for the company I'm currently working in, Datarisk, where I'm surrounded by phenomenal people who always remind me of the importance of pushing forward, diminishing the fear that naturally comes when entering new countries.

Finally, a special thanks for everybody that took any amount of time to read any draft I had of this thesis, providing honest feedback to enhance my final project before being graduated as a computer engineer.
