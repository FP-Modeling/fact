Chapter 4, \textit{Enlightenment}, explained how to execute the simulation using function as the driver. Later, a guided example was provided to grasp how the side-effects and the implicit recursion are capable of solving, via the \texttt{Integrator} and \texttt{Dynamics} types, differential equations. This chapter will show some graphs to evaluate if the generated results actually match reality, i.e.,  check if the answers portray physical phenomena within acceptable approximations. At the end, two major concerns will be identified for further investigation in chapter 6, \textit{The Speed Pill: Caching}, and in chapter 7, \textit{Surpassing Discreteness}.
