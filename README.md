# mivika

Mivika is a modern and primitive version of [aivika](https://github.com/dsorokin/aivika). This project has the main goal of incresing the understanding of aivika incrementally, using the earlier versions of the code (the earliest version is only available in [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-0.1)). Hence, it is necessary to update the code, since the ghc compiler changed a lot since back these versions where developed.
